The algorithm finds the shortest path for the frog that has to escape from the stork through the river. On the river there are lilies that are changing positions in each frog's jump. The frog is jumping on the lilies from one edge of the river to another. Algorithm is finding the best path that is the shortest one and not too exhausting for the frog.
